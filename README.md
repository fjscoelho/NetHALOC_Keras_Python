# NetHALOC-Keras-Python
Implementation in Python of the NetHALOC neural network for loop closing detection underwater

This implementation needs the uploaded DATASETS.TXT files to charge the images into the neural network. 
Every text file contains information about the images contained in each dataset, queries and database images, and the relation of each query with its corresponding image in the database that closes a loop with the mentioned query. Each query has, at least, one image closing a loop with it in the database.
Please, just to test, download the queries and the database images from https://github.com/srv/Underwater-Dataset, and unzip all queries in a folder and all database images in another folder. Then, be sure that the path where you unzipped the images is coincident with the one set in the DATASETS.TXT files. 
The paper is under review. Please, contact with the authors for further information.
