# NetHALOC-Keras-Python
Implementation in Python of the NetHALOC neural network for loop closing detection underwater

This implementation needs the uploaded DATASETS.TXT files to upload the images into the network. 
Every text file contains information about the images contained in each dataset, queries and database images, and the relation of each query with the corresponding image in the database that close a loop with the query. Each query has, at least, one image closing a loop in the database.
Please, just to test, download the queries and the database images from https://github.com/srv/Underwater-Dataset, and unzip all queries in a folder and all database images in another folder. Then, be sure that the path where you unzipped the images is correct in the DTASET.TXT files.
